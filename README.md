The Application shall:
  - take a person's age in years and convert it into seconds.
  - take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.
      this is essentially the same as the first one, as the user has to enter their birth date and the current date in order to calculate their age.
  - return the age of a human in Mercury years.
  - return the age of a human in Venus years.
  - return the age of a human in Mars years.
  - return the age of a human in Jupiter years.
  - determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet.
      Because I used a random number generator, i'm not able to determine how many years exactly should be expected with each output. However, I did test that the random number generated is less than 50 (a number I just came up with.)
