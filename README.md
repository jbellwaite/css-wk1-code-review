# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### A Mystical Age Predictor

#### by **Jessie Waite**

## Description

This application was made to satisfy the week one code review for Epicodus Javascript course. The application is able to convert a person's age on earth to a person's age if they were on another planet in our galaxy. The application is also able to "predict" the user's life expectancy, and tell the user until how old the user will live on each planet.

The application displays a form that accepts input from the user. The application asks the user to enter their age and the current date. When the user presses the submit button after the form, the application starts a series of calculations. First, the application converts the user's age into seconds. The application then converts the users' age in seconds to the user's age on each planet in years.

The application also has the capability to "magically" predict how long the user will live. The application does this by generating a random number between zero and fifty, and then adds the random number to the user's current age. This is obviously by no means scientific, and the user can re-submit the form multiple times to get multiple answers for how long they will live.
